Top K Frequent Elements | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) | **Bucket Sort Algorithm** | Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted array elements into several groups called buckets. Each bucket is then sorted by using any of the suitable sorting algorithms or recursively applying the same bucket algorithm. Finally, the sorted buckets are combined to form a final sorted array. Time and memory complexity: O(N). [Link1](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bucket-sort), [Link2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bucket-sort-2/) |
| 28. Implement strStr() | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) | **KMP Algorithm** | The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n). The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match. Time and memory complexity: O(N).
