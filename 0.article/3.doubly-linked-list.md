We have previously discussed about singly liked list but now we will discuss another type of linked list name doubly linked list. The main characterstics of doubly linked list is, in here we need store previous node reference with current value and next node reference.
## Difference between singly linked list and doubly linked list
On the other hand, a doubly linked list consists of nodes where each node has two pointers - one to the next node and another to the previous node in the sequence. This allows you to traverse the list in both directions, from the head to the tail and from the tail to the head, which makes it easier to implement certain algorithms such as reversing the list or finding the kth last element of the list.

While doubly linked lists offer more flexibility than singly linked lists, they also require more memory to store the extra pointer in each node, and the extra complexity can make them more difficult to implement and maintain. The choice between the two types of linked lists depends on the requirements of the specific use case.
