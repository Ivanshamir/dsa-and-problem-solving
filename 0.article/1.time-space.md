# A Comprehensive Guide to Time and Space Complexity
When we solve problems with different type of algorithms, we need to analyze the computational complexity of these solutions. There are two methods for analyzing the complexity of a problem. They are: time complexity and space complexity.

## Time Complexity
From wikipedia: `In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.` In simple word: time complexity is a measure of how much time an algorithm takes to execute as a function, based on the length of the input. It is usually expressed as a function of the input size, represented by the letter n example: O(n). And we call it order of n or Big (O) of n. But what is Big(O) and why it is important? In simple terms, if a program can able to handle large amount of input and the amount of time it takes as same as a small amount of input, then we can rate it well according to Big O Notation.
### The Big-O complexity chart:

It's important to note that time complexity does not measure the actual time an algorithm takes to execute, but rather how the execution time increases with the size of the input. The actual execution time depends on several factors such as the hardware, programming language, and implementation of the algorithm. Enough talking, now let's take a look at an example below and analysis the time complexity:
```
let sum = 0
for(let i = N; i > 0; i++)
    for(let j = 0; j < i; j++)
        sum += 1;
```
Now in the worst case, let's consider the scenarios:
1. N*constant operations will run for input.
2. The outer loop i will run at N times.
3. For each i, the inner j will run at N times.
So total execution time will be N*N*constant + constant. Now we will ignore the lower order terms as those are relatively insignificant for large inputs, therefore only the highest order term will be taken (without constant) which is N*N in this case.

Space Complexity
Space complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm requires as a function of the input size. It is also expressed as a function of the input size n. For example, if an algorithm takes O(n) space, it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input.

Similar to time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using Big O notation. In this case, the worst-case scenario is considered, that is, the scenario where the algorithm requires the most memory to execute.

It's important to note that space complexity does not measure the actual amount of memory an algorithm uses, but rather how the memory usage increases with the size of the input. The actual memory usage also depends on several factors such as the hardware, programming language, and implementation of the algorithm.

Importance of Time and Space Complexity
The time and space complexity of an algorithm are important because they help us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms for solving the same problem. When dealing with large datasets, the time and space complexity of an algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of a system. Therefore, it is important to choose algorithms that are efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

In addition, time and space complexity can also help us to identify the bottlenecks in an algorithm and optimize it for better performance. By analyzing the time and space complexity of an algorithm, we can identify the parts of the algorithm that are taking the most time or memory and optimize them to reduce the overall time and space complexity.

Conclusion
Time and space complexity are important concepts in computer science that are used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. Time complexity measures the time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size, while space complexity measures the memory an algorithm requires as a function of the input size. By analyzing the time and space complexity of an algorithm, we can choose algorithms that are efficient in terms of both time and space, identify the bottlenecks in an algorithm, and optimize it for better performance.
