When we save data in array like data structure then the first element is positioned at first in array which we called index 0 then the second element is positioned at  
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a reference to an object and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are commonly used in computer science for their efficient insertion and deletion operations. In this article, we will discuss the different types of linked lists and their implementation in JavaScript.

Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is the most basic type of linked list. Each node in the list stores a reference to the next node in the sequence, except for the last node which stores a null reference. Here is an example implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript:

```
class SinglyLinkedListNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class SinglyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(data) {
    const node = new SinglyLinkedListNode(data);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = node;
    } else {
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    this.size++;
  }

  remove(data) {
    let current = this.head;
    let previous = null;

    while (current !== null) {
      if (current.data === data) {
        if (previous === null) {
          this.head = current.next;
        } else {
          previous.next = current.next;
        }
        this.size--;
        return current.data;
      }
      previous = current;
      current = current.next;
    }

    return null;
  }

  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    let current = this.head;
    while (current !== null) {
      yield current.data;
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we have implemented a SinglyLinkedListNode class that represents a node in the list, and a SinglyLinkedList class that represents the list itself. The add method adds a new node to the end of the list, and the remove method removes a node with a given data value from the list. We have also implemented an iterator using the generator function syntax, which allows us to easily iterate over the elements of the list using a for...of loop.

Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a variation of the singly linked list, where each node stores a reference to the previous node as well as the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions. Here is an example implementation of a doubly linked list in JavaScript:

```
class DoublyLinkedListNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.prev = null;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(data) {
    const node = new DoublyLinkedListNode(data);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = node;
    } else {
      node.prev = this.tail;
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    this.size++;
  }

  remove(data) {
    let current = this.head;

    while (current !== null) {
      if (current.data === data) {
        if (current === this.head) {
          this.head = current.next;
          if (this.head !== null) {
            this.head.prev = null;
          }
        } else if (current === this.tail) {
          this.tail = current.prev;
          if (this.tail !== null) {
            this.tail.next = null
```
