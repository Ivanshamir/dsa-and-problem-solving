When we save data in array like data structure then the first element is positioned at first in that array(index 0) then the second element is positioned at second(index 1), third element is positioned at third(index 2) and all other elements are positioned at sequentially. Now in this article we will learn about a new data structure name linked list. In linked list, data are not stored in squentially but in diffrent memory locations. So we can not get data by using index, like array. In here data are linked through pointers. In details, a linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a reference to an object and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It is commonly used for their efficient insertion and deletion operations. Here is an image for better understanding:


There are three common types of Linked List:
1.Singly Linked List
2.Doubly Linked List
3.Circular Linked List

## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is the most basic type of linked list. Each node in the list stores a pointer to the next node in the sequence, except for the last node which stores a null reference. 

### Implementation
To implement a linked list in javascript we will follow the object-oriented way. So that we need a node class and a linked list class

#### Class Node
To represent a node class, we need to have two properties. First is `value` that will represent the data to be stored and the `next` the property represents a pointer to the next item in the list.

```
class Node {
    constructor(value, next = null) {
        this.value = value; 
        this.next = next; 
    }
}
```

#### Class LinkedList
This class represents a linked list, this class will have the head property that represents the initial node. On startup, the header will be set to null. The LinkedList class will not have any nodes associated with it at startup.



class SinglyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(data) {
    const node = new SinglyLinkedListNode(data);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = node;
    } else {
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    this.size++;
  }

  remove(data) {
    let current = this.head;
    let previous = null;

    while (current !== null) {
      if (current.data === data) {
        if (previous === null) {
          this.head = current.next;
        } else {
          previous.next = current.next;
        }
        this.size--;
        return current.data;
      }
      previous = current;
      current = current.next;
    }

    return null;
  }

  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    let current = this.head;
    while (current !== null) {
      yield current.data;
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we have implemented a SinglyLinkedListNode class that represents a node in the list, and a SinglyLinkedList class that represents the list itself. The add method adds a new node to the end of the list, and the remove method removes a node with a given data value from the list. We have also implemented an iterator using the generator function syntax, which allows us to easily iterate over the elements of the list using a for...of loop.

Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a variation of the singly linked list, where each node stores a reference to the previous node as well as the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions. Here is an example implementation of a doubly linked list in JavaScript:

```
class DoublyLinkedListNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.prev = null;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(data) {
    const node = new DoublyLinkedListNode(data);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = node;
    } else {
      node.prev = this.tail;
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    this.size++;
  }

  remove(data) {
    let current = this.head;

    while (current !== null) {
      if (current.data === data) {
        if (current === this.head) {
          this.head = current.next;
          if (this.head !== null) {
            this.head.prev = null;
          }
        } else if (current === this.tail) {
          this.tail = current.prev;
          if (this.tail !== null) {
            this.tail.next = null
```
